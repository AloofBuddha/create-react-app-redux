## My Summary

This app is created by bootstrapping Create React App and adding no additional dependencies besides for Moment.js for date formatting. Given the size of the app and the time constraints I used pure React with Hooks instead of opting for a Redux based solution, however with more time that might have been an appropriate route. CSS is pure CSS and relatively minimal. App is minimally responsive in that the text sizes shrink on page shrink and everything remains predictably laid out using basic flexbox. There is no Jest snapshot testing as I don't know that currently and didn't have enough time to implement a test.
